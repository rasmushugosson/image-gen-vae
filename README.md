# Image Gen VAE

This project was written for our bachelor's degree project in computer science at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden.

## Getting started

*Details will be published later.*

### Set up remote Docker environment for GPU-accelerated training

This installation guide is based on [this article](https://www.pendragonai.com/setup-tensorflow-gpu-windows-docker-wsl2/) from Pendragon AI.

The only modification we made was to replace these commands:

```bash
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:2.14.0-gpu

docker run --name my_tensorflow -it --gpus all tensorflow/tensorflow:2.14.0-gpu bash
```

With these instead:

```bash
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:2.16.1-gpu

docker run --name my_tensorflow -it --gpus all tensorflow/tensorflow:2.16.1-gpu bash

```

To get the address of the container, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs image-ldm | grep -o 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=[^ ]*' | tail -n1
```
